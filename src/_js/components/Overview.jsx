    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Most illustrations are designed for specific product and context. However some common elements may be used as design resources to create new illustrations. Each illustration in the catalog has a rasterized format file (*.png) and a vector format file (*.pdf). You may use the png directly or use a vector editing tool such as Adobe Illustrator to edit or re-assemble content.</p>
